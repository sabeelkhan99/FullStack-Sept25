Using state is important in React because it allows components to manage their own data and re-render themselves when that data changes.

State is local to a component, meaning that changes to state within a component don't affect other components. This encapsulation of state helps to keep the logic of your application organized and maintainable.

Now, regarding why props can't be used to manage the state is

Immutability: Props are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed from within the component that receives them. In the counter example, we need to be able to modify the count value when the user clicks the increment or decrement buttons. Since props cannot be modified, they are not suitable for managing the state in this scenario.

Single Source of Truth: In React, it's a best practice to have a single source of truth for your data. By using state, you ensure that the component itself is the authority on its state, rather than relying on external data (props) that could change unpredictably.

Re-rendering: When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the updated state. This is essential for maintaining a responsive user interface. Props, on the other hand, are static and do not trigger re-renders when they change. If we were to use props to manage the count in our example, we would have to manually trigger re-renders, which goes against React's declarative programming model.

In summary, while props are great for passing data from parent to child components, they are not suitable for managing dynamic data that needs to change over time within a component. For that, we use state, which provides a way for components to manage and update their own data.

and This is the basic differnce between State and Props
